    "idea": "Async-first project management tool for remote FinTech teams (20-50 employees) that auto-generates daily standups from Slack/GitHub activity, reducing synchronous meetings by 60% and saving 10 hours per week per team.",

    "problemStatement": "Remote teams waste 10+ hours/week in synchronous status meetings due to timezone differences, causing burnout and reducing deep work time",
