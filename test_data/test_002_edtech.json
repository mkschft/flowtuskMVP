  "input": {
    "idea": "Gamified GCSE exam prep platform for UK Year 10-11 students that uses spaced repetition algorithms to boost retention by 35%, with AI-generated practice questions aligned to AQA and Edexcel exam boards.",
    "targetMarket": "UK secondary school students (Year 10-11, ages 14-16) preparing for GCSE exams, plus their parents seeking affordable alternatives to £40/hour tutoring",
    "problemStatement": "Traditional revision is passive (reading notes) and ineffective, leading to poor retention and exam anxiety. Private tutoring costs £40/hour and isn't scalable.",
    "solutionHypothesis": "Gamification + spaced repetition creates engaging daily habits, improving retention by 35% compared to passive revision, at 1/10th the cost of tutoring",

  "qualityChecks": {
    "specificity": "Should mention exam boards (AQA, Edexcel), Year 10-11, 35% retention metric",
