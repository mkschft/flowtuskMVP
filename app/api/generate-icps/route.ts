Each ICP should be unique and target a different segment. Create believable persona details that represent the archetype.

Return ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:

  "icps": [
    {
      "id": "unique-id",
      "title": "Short segment title (e.g., 'Enterprise CTOs')",
      "description": "One sentence description of the segment",
      "painPoints": ["Short pain 1-2 words", "Another short pain", "Third pain"],
      "goals": ["goal1", "goal2", "goal3"],
      "demographics": "Brief demographics and firmographics",
      "personaName": "Full name (realistic, diverse)",
      "personaRole": "Job title",
      "personaCompany": "Company type with size (e.g., 'Acme Corp (200 employees)')",
      "location": "City name",
      "country": "Country"

    "painPointsWithMetrics": [
      {
        "pain": "Pain point description",
        "metric": "Quantified impact with numbers (e.g., '15+ hours/week wasted' or '$5,000 penalty risk')"
      }
    ],
    "opportunityMultiplier": "2-5" // realistic multiplier number as string
  }
}

IMPORTANT: Keep painPoints very SHORT (1-3 words max) like "Time constraints", "Budget limits", "Manual processes"

Persona guidelines:
- Use diverse, realistic names from various backgrounds
- Match role seniority to the ICP segment
- Company size should align with segment (SMB vs Enterprise)
- Each persona should feel like a real person you'd meet

Brand Color Inference:
Analyze the website content and infer 2 brand colors (primary and secondary) as hex codes. Base this on:
- Company name associations (e.g., Stripe = purple, Notion = black/white)
- Industry standards (fintech = blue/green, creative = vibrant)
- Content tone and keywords
Return these in the brandColors field.

Summary with Metrics:
Generate a compelling business summary with QUANTIFIED pain points:
- businessDescription: 2-3 sentences describing what they do, who they serve, and their value prop
- targetMarket: Describe their ideal customer market
- painPointsWithMetrics: 3 pain points with SPECIFIC NUMBERS. Use realistic industry metrics like:
  * Time waste: "10-15 hours/week", "40% of workday"
  * Cost: "$5,000+ penalties", "30% budget overrun", "$50k/year wasted"
  * Error rates: "25% manual errors", "3x higher failure rate"
  * Growth limits: "50% capacity constraint", "Can't scale beyond 10 clients"
- opportunityMultiplier: Realistic number (2-5x) based on pain severity and market opportunity

Make numbers realistic and industry-appropriate. For enterprise software, use bigger numbers. For SMB tools, use smaller but relatable numbers.`,
