# --- Scopes (examples) ---
# copilot, flows, icps, value-prop, email, linkedin, auth, db, api, ui

# --- AI-Friendly Context ---
# When changing DB: specify table name, columns, migration number
# When touching evidence chain: confirm sourceFactIds/evidence preserved
# When fixing bugs: include error message or symptom
# When adding features: state the user benefit

# --- Examples ---
# feat(flows): add soft delete with archived_at timestamp
# Database: positioning_flows - added archived_at column (nullable timestamptz)
#
# fix(value-prop): validate sourceFactIds array exists before rendering
# Evidence: added Zod validation ensuring all variations have sourceFactIds
#
# refactor(api): extract evidence validation into shared util
# Evidence: preserved - moved validation logic to lib/validators/evidence.ts
