- No real progress indicators
- Generic completion messages

**After:**
- **Step 1 - Analyze:** Journey mapping
  - `✅ Mapped 7-day journey`
  - `✅ Identified key decision points`
- **Step 2 - Sequence:** Planning
  - `✅ Planned 7 emails`
  - `✅ Defined sequence flow`
- **Step 3 - Emails:** AI generation with time estimate (20-40s)
  - `✅ Generated 7 emails`
  - `✅ 21 total subject lines`
- **Step 4 - Timeline:** Visual timeline
  - `✅ Timeline: Day 0 → Day 7`
  - `✅ Ready to deploy`

### 5. Data Flow Enhancement ✅
**Location:** `app/app/page.tsx` line 1884-1895

**Fixed:** Added `factsJson` and `websiteContent` to email sequence API call (was missing)

## Technical Details

### Real Timing Measurements
```typescript
const analyzeStart = Date.now();
// ... do work ...
updateThinkingStep(msgId, 'analyze', {
  status: 'complete',
  duration: Date.now() - analyzeStart, // Real duration
  substeps: ['✅ Actual results...']
});
```

### No More Fake Delays
- Removed: `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))`
- Removed: Nested `setTimeout(() => {...}, 300)` chains
- Now: Real API calls determine timing

### Informative Substeps
- **While running:** Show what's happening + time estimates
  - "Generating with AI (10-20s)..."
  - "Extracting structured facts (15-30s)..."
- **After completion:** Show actual metrics + checkmarks
  - "✅ Generated 3 customer profiles"
  - "✅ Email body: 250 words"

## User Impact

### Better UX
- ✅ Users see realistic time estimates while waiting
- ✅ Actual metrics shown after each step completes
- ✅ No fake delays - authentic progress tracking
- ✅ Consistent UX across all generation flows

### Improved Perceived Performance
Even though timing stays the same, users feel better because:
- They know what's happening ("Extracting facts with AI...")
- They see time estimates ("10-20s...")
- They get real results ("Generated 45 facts")
- They're not waiting blindly

## Testing Checklist

Ready for demo! Test the complete flow:

1. ✅ **Website Analysis** (taxstar.app or any website)
   - Look for: "Extracting structured facts with AI (15-30s)..."
   - Verify: Checkmarks show actual fact count

2. ✅ **ICP Generation**
   - Look for: "Generating customer profiles with AI (10-20s)..."
   - Verify: Shows pain point count

3. ✅ **Value Prop** (auto-generated after ICP selection)
   - Verify: Real timing measurements

4. ✅ **LinkedIn Outreach**
   - Look for: Three distinct steps with real metrics
   - Verify: Character counts, personalization tips

5. ✅ **One-Time Email**
   - Look for: Word count, subject line variations
