# Conversation Management Features ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** Complete

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. ‚úÖ Delete Conversations
Users can now delete conversations with a single click.

**How it works:**
- Hover over any conversation in the sidebar
- Trash icon appears on the right
- Click to delete (with confirmation prompt)
- Automatically switches to another conversation if deleting active one
- Creates new conversation if deleting the last one

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
const deleteConversation = (convId: string) => {
  // Filters out deleted conversation
  // Switches to next available conversation
  // Creates new one if none left
  // Cleans up memory manager
}
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- ‚úÖ Deleting active conversation ‚Üí switches to next
- ‚úÖ Deleting last conversation ‚Üí creates new one
- ‚úÖ Memory cleanup in localStorage
- ‚úÖ Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Auto-Rename Conversations
Conversations automatically get renamed based on the website URL being analyzed.

**How it works:**
- User pastes website URL (e.g., `https://taxstar.app`)
- System extracts hostname: `taxstar.app`
- Conversation title updates from "New conversation" ‚Üí `taxstar.app`
- Title persists across sessions

**Technical Details:**
```typescript
// Already implemented at line 973
if (urlPattern.test(userInput)) {
  const url = userInput.match(urlPattern)?.[0] || "";
  updateConversationTitle(new URL(url).hostname);
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Easy to identify conversations by website
- No more generic "New conversation" titles
- Automatic, no user action needed

## UI/UX Improvements

### Sidebar Conversation Items

**Before:**
```
[Icon] New conversation
```

**After:**
```
[Icon] taxstar.app                    [üóëÔ∏è]
       ‚Üë                              ‚Üë
    Auto-renamed               Delete (on hover)
```

**Visual Design:**
- Delete icon hidden by default
- Appears on hover with opacity transition
- Red tint on hover for destructive action
- Positioned absolutely on the right
- Small size (3.5x3.5) to not dominate UI

---

## State Management

### Conversations Array
```typescript
const [conversations, setConversations] = useState<Conversation[]>([]);
```

Each conversation contains:
- Unique ID
- Title (auto-updated on URL analysis)
- Messages history
- Memory (website URL, facts, ICP, etc.)
- Generation state
- User journey tracking

### Persistence
- All conversations saved to `localStorage`
- Active conversation ID remembered
- Survives page refreshes
- Memory manager synced on changes
