There’s a mismatch in food systems
----------------------------------

One third of all produced food goes to waste while millions of people cannot afford quality meals.

 The food industry lacks tools to efficiently and safely redistribute all the perfectly good food. And at the same time cities and municipalities are struggling to meet their ambitious food waste reduction goals.

How can we help?
----------------

Cities & Municipalities

#### Reduce costs, support local wellbeing

Meet climate, food waste, and social policy targets by utilizing Zipli's real-time food tracking platform and communication tool. Cut waste costs, strengthen ESG compliance, and improve social wellbeing.

HoReCa & Retail

-----------------------------------------

At the very core of saving still perfectly good food for human consumption is finding a match with organisations that have excess food and those who can make use of it. Our mobile app solves the daily headache of redirecting excess food to people in need.

How it works
------------

1

#### Post donations or food requests

Food providers like restaurant or supermarket employees add excess items into the app. Food receivers like charity volunteers create one-time or recurring requests.

2

#### Get matches to your needs

Zipli matches offers and requests in real-time, items get picked up and delivered and users confirm transactions to ensure food safety.

3

#### Receive actionable insights

Transaction data is collected automatically for monitoring and reporting purposes. And on top of it all, we provide users AI-based recommendations on measures to take to further reduce waste and meet impact goals.
