### Brand Guidelines

We're not big on rules, but we've created a set of guidelines to help you bring our brand to life. 

 On this site, you'll find high-level guidelines and the assets our partners use most. Check out our Big Green Guide if you'd like to take a deeper dive into our brand.

#### Our Personality

Our brand is defined by these traits that we put into action across all our campaigns and channels. It's flexible enough to work across the entire Hulu ecosystem, while keeping our place as a pioneer who breaks the rules for all the right reasons.

### Logo

Whenever possible, the Hulu logo should be green. In cases where we want to make an impact by using a green background, the logo can be black. Color combinations are shown in order of priority.

#### Safe Zone

The logo's safe zone is equivalent to the height of the "u" on all sides.

### Color

Hulu green is our primary brand color. It represents the fresh distinctiveness of our brand and stands out from more traditional entertainment palettes. Black is our secondary color and is used over green. Dynamic Gradient is used to create depth and bring a cinematic quality to designs.

#### Printing Hulu Green

Our green is important to us. If you ask people "What comes to mind when you think of Hulu?", the word "green" is one of the most common responses. So, understandably, we’re quite particular about it.

### Typography

Typography is our visual voice, bringing range, nuance, and attitude to what we have to say. Hulu uses the Graphik type family in all applications.

[Purchase Graphik](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/graphik)Vendors should coordinate with Commercial Type on purchase of the appropriate license for their project (e.g. Web, App, Desktop, etc.)![Image 7](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/typeguide-desktop-tablet.svg)![Image 8](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/typeguide-desktop-tablet.svg)![Image 9](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/typeguide-mobile.svg)
### Iconography

Icons are part our emotive and navigational language. They also bring attitude and texture to our stories. The icon and the rounded Vessel should always have a contrasting color.

### Illustration

Our illustration style builds off the shape of the Vessel. Adding a little spice (and cute characters) to our communications.

### The Vessel

The Vessel is a visual metaphor for TV, redefining what TV is. A system born from our logo, it is more than just a frame. As we fill it with meaning, it becomes the connective tissue across all brand touchpoints.

![Image 16: The Vessel](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/vessel_structure.png)

### Use the following formulas to make your Vessel perfect.

#### Stroke Weight

Divide longest edge of the Vessel by 100.

![Image 17: vessel-steps](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/vessel-1.png)

Vessel width: 904px

 Stroke weight: 9px

#### Corner Radius

Divide shortest edge of the Vessel by 6.

![Image 18: vessel-steps](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/vessel-2.png)

Vessel height: 231px

 Corner radius: 38px

If using multiple Vessels in a single piece of creative, all corner radius and stroke weights should align to the average (not smallest, not largest).

### Grid

Don’t underestimate the power of the grid. 

 A simple, flexible system that brings Hulu together on every platform. 

 Using the following approach, 

 we can create a consistent 1:1 grid system that works across all formats.

![Image 19: Step 1](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/hulu-in-a-sentence-1.full_.png)
Define the aspect ratio of the format.

![Image 20: Step 2](https://greenhouse.hulu.com/app/uploads/sites/12/2023/10/hulu-in-a-sentence-2.full_.png)
Use the aspect ratio to create a 1:1 grid. 16 units across by 9 down.
